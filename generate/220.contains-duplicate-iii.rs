 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,1]\n3\n0'
 *
 * Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices
 * i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and
 * nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most
 * k.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
 * Output: true
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * 0 <= k <= 10^4
 * 0 <= t <= 2^31 - 1
